2. **GitHub Repos** - Where project work happens (if applicable)

4. **60_life/areas/people/** - Personal notes that don't belong in CRM

### When a Customer Contacts You
1. Do the work in their **project repo** (if applicable)
2. Respond via **same channel** they contacted you on
3. Update their **CRM entry** if needed
