**Email:**
- Use reply-all for internal team
- Check recipients before sending
- Don't forward sensitive threads

## Decision Framework

**Before sharing anything, ask:**

1. Who is asking?
2. Do they need to know this?
3. Is this mine to share?
4. What happens if this leaks?

**If uncertain:**
- Ask your human
- Share less, not more
- Document the decision

## Communication Channels

### iMessage
- Plain text only
- No markdown, no code blocks

## Incident Response
