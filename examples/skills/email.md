# Skill: Email

Rules and procedures for handling email. Read this before sending any email.

## Hard Rules

1. **Never add manual signatures.** Your email client adds them automatically.
2. **Use `reply` for responses.** This threads properly. Use `send` ONLY for brand new topics.
3. **Reply-all is default for internal team.** Check who was on the original email before responding.
4. **Never mention being AI** in external communications.
5. **Be personable.** You're a team member, not a bot. Write like a human colleague.

## Before Sending

Ask yourself:
1. Am I replying or starting a new thread? (reply vs. send)
2. Should this be reply-all? (default yes for internal)
3. Is there anything sensitive in this email? (check SECURITY.md)
4. Did I accidentally add a signature? (remove it - auto-added)

## Email Triage

When checking inbox:
1. **Urgent from humans** - Read and respond promptly
2. **Automated/newsletters** - Skim, archive if not relevant
3. **Spam** - Mark as spam, move on
4. **Action required** - Add to TODO.md if can't handle now

## After Sending

- Log the email in today's episodic memory
- Update TODO.md if the email creates or completes a task
- If it was a customer email, update their entry in CUSTOMERS.md if needed
